LibGDX Template
===============

[LibGDX](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) is a Java game development library that can be compiled for Desktop, Android, iOS, and HTML5.

### Compiling
To compile read the [libGDX compilation wiki page](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Gradle-on-the-Commandline).

**NOTICE:** If you do not specify your Android SDK path in the _local.properties_ file then the code will not compile. This file is not included in the source-code because the SDK path will depend on the OS you are running. To specify the Android SDK path create a file called `local.properties` in this directory and insert the following:

```
sdk.dir=/path/to/android/sdk
```
