Game Templates
==============

In this repository you can find a collection of templates to quick start programming games in multiple languages and multiple libraries.

### Compiling
This information will depend on the template, please look at the individual template README.md file in order to get compiling information (if applicable).

### Contributing
You got something to contribute? We're always looking for new templates! Just create a pull request.

### License
Since these are templates we are being a bit more liberal than usual with the license. You can use these templates under the terms and conditions of the [MIT](/LICENSE). The reason for this is precisely that these are templates, and therefore only contain the basics, so we don't believe it is fair to put such a strict license such as the AGPLv3 or even the LGPLv3. But precisely because this is under the MIT license all derivatives (including proprietary derivatives) are required to refer to this code making it easier for other developers to use these templates.
